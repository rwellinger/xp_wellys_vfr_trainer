"""
SkunkCrafts Updater control-file generator for xp_wellys_vfr_trainer.

Walks an installed plugin tree and emits the control files the updater
compares against:

    skunkcrafts_updater_whitelist.txt   <relative_path>|<crc32 unsigned decimal>
    skunkcrafts_updater_sizeslist.txt   <relative_path>|<size in bytes>
    skunkcrafts_updater.cfg             rendered from the .cfg.template (version filled in)

It also writes a skunkcrafts_updater_oncelist.txt so user-owned files
(settings.json) are pulled only when missing and never overwritten. Such
files are deliberately kept OUT of the whitelist and sizeslist: a whitelist
CRC32 (or a sizeslist entry) is what the updater diffs against, so once the
user edits settings.json its checksum drifts and a client that honours the
whitelist over the oncelist would flag it out-of-sync and clobber it (wiping
backend_mode, api_key_saved, ...). Listing it in the oncelist ALONE preserves
the "download only if absent" behaviour without ever giving the updater a
reason to overwrite a present copy.

Anything not in the whitelist is left untouched by the updater, so the
user's runtime caches (airport_scores.json, session_reports.json,
imgui.ini) survive every update. Those are also excluded here so they are
never accidentally tracked if present in the staged tree.

Usage:
    python3 tools/skunkcrafts/generate.py \
        --tree  "<X-Plane>/Resources/available plugins/xp_wellys_vfr_trainer" \
        --version 0.1.0

Run it against the *release* tree you are about to publish (the same layout
`make install` produces), then commit/push that tree + the control files to
the `release` branch the cfg `module` URL points at.
